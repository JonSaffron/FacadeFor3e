Facade for 3e
=============

A small library which can be used to simplify the task of interacting with Elite 3e.

3e provides a TransactionService web service which you can use to run a particular process, but it's not particularly easy to use. This library provides a wrapper around the web service making creating request and interpreting responses straightforward and therefore quicker to write.

Run any 3e process from within your own .net application, so that you create your own matter opening website, generate proformas, or update conflicts information.

At present it offers two functions:

	- Run a 3e process

	- Add an attachment
